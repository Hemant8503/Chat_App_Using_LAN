# Chat_App_Using_LAN
### Introduction:
 - The primary goal of the "Chat_App_Using_LAN" project is to create a communication platform that enables users to exchange messages over the same Local Area Network (LAN) in real-time. 
 - This application is particularly useful for scenarios where users are physically close to each other and need a quick and efficient means of communication.

### Why (Need)? Problem in Real-Time:
 - In our department, power failures or disruptions in the power connection sometimes occur, leading to a breakdown in communication. To address this issue, we've developed an application where communication occurs over LAN.
 - The need for a LAN-based chat application arises from the limitations or challenges associated with using external, internet-dependent communication tools. In real-time scenarios, such as office environments, collaborative projects, or events, users may face issues like latency, dependency on external servers, and potential security concerns. A dedicated LAN chat app aims to address these challenges by providing a localized and secure communication solution.

### Real-Time Use:
 - This app successfully resolves our departmental communication issues by providing smooth communication over LAN.
 - The app ensures secure communication by employing the AES 256-bits encryption algorithm.
 - Enables users within the same LAN to communicate instantly without relying on external networks.
 - Facilitates quick and efficient communication in scenarios where immediate responses are crucial, such as in offices, workplaces, collaborative projects, conferences, and events.

### Advantages:
 - Low Latency: Communication occurs within the LAN, minimizing delays.
 - Increased Security: Messages stay within the local network, reducing exposure to external threats.
 - Resource Efficiency: Utilizes existing LAN infrastructure, reducing dependence on external servers.

### Working Flow:

 - User Authentication: Users authenticate within the LAN to access the chat application.
 - LAN Discovery: The application identifies and displays other users on the same LAN.
 - Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real time.
 - Security Measures: Implement encryption and secure protocols to protect the privacy of messages within the LAN.

### Requirements for Making Chat_App_Using_LAN:
 - Programming Language: Python
 - User Interface (UI): Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface using GUI frameworks like Tkinter.
 - Security Measures: Implement secure authentication and encryption mechanisms.
 - LAN Discovery: Develop a mechanism to discover and display users within the same LAN.
 - Real-Time Communication Protocol: Choose an appropriate real-time communication protocol like UDP.
